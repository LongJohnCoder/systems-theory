>2.8. Building modules for a precompiled kernel</H1
><P
>	Obviously, we strongly suggest you to recompile your kernel, so that you can enable a number of useful debugging features, such as
	forced module unloading (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD</TT
>): when this option is enabled, you can force the kernel to unload a module even  
	when it believes it is unsafe, via a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rmmod -f module</B
> command. This option can save you a lot of time and a number of reboots 
	during the development of a module.
	</P
><P
>	Nevertheless, there is a number of cases in which you may want to load your module into a precompiled running kernel, such as the ones shipped
	with common Linux distributions, or a kernel you have compiled in the past. In certain circumstances you could require to compile and insert a 
	module into a running kernel which you are not allowed to recompile, or on a machine that you prefer not to reboot.
	If you can't think of a case that will force you to use modules for a precompiled kernel you
	might want to skip this and treat the rest of this chapter as a big footnote.
	</P
><P
>	Now, if you just install a kernel source tree, use it to compile your kernel module and you try to insert your module into the kernel,
	in most cases you would obtain an error as follows:

	Consequently, we want to compile our module in an environment which was identical to the one in which our precompiled kernel was built.
	How to do this, is the subject of the remainder of this chapter.</P
><P
>	First of all, make sure that a kernel source tree is available, having exactly the same version as 
	your current kernel. Then, find the configuration file which was used to compile your precompiled kernel. 
	Usually, this is available in your current <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/boot</TT
> directory, under a name like <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>config-2.6.x</TT
>. 
	You may just want to copy it to your kernel source tree:
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
> cp /boot/config-`uname -r` /usr/src/linux-`uname -r`/.config</B
>. </P
><P
>	Let's focus again on the previous error message: a closer look at the version magic strings suggests that, even with two configuration files
	which are exactly the same, a slight difference in the version magic could be possible, and it is sufficient to prevent insertion of the module 
	into the kernel.
	That slight difference, namely the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>custom</TT
> string which appears in the module's version magic and not in the kernel's one,
	is due to a modification with respect to the original, in the makefile that some distribution include.
	Then, examine your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux/Makefile</TT
>, and make sure that the specified version information matches exactly the one used
	for your current kernel. For example, you makefile could start as follows: </P

>	In this case, you need to restore the value of symbol <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>EXTRAVERSION</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>-1.358</TT
>. 
	We suggest to keep a backup copy of the makefile used to compile your kernel available in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/modules/2.6.5-1.358/build</TT
>.
	A simple <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cp /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/Makefile /usr/src/linux-`uname -r`</B
> should suffice.
	Additionally, if you already started a kernel build with the previous (wrong) <TT

	you should also rerun <B

>make</B
