CLASS="FILENAME"
>softdog.ko</TT
>.</P
><P
>Next, modprobe looks through the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/modules/version/modules.dep</TT
>, to see if other modules
	must be loaded before the requested module may be loaded.  This file is created by <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>depmod -a</B
> and 
	contains module dependencies. For example, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>msdos.ko</TT
> requires the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>fat.ko</TT
> module 
	to be already loaded into the kernel. The requested module has a dependency on another module if the other module defines 
	symbols	(variables or functions) that the requested module uses.</P
><P
>Lastly, modprobe uses insmod to first load any prerequisite modules into the kernel, and then the requested module.
	modprobe directs insmod to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/modules/version/</TT

>, the standard directory for modules.  insmod is 
	intended to be fairly dumb about the location of modules, whereas modprobe is aware of the default location of modules,
	knows how to figure out the dependencies and load the modules in the right order.
	So for example,	if you wanted to load the msdos module, you'd have to either run:</P

><P
>Linux distros provide modprobe, insmod and depmod as a package called module-init-tools. In previous versions
	that package was called modutils. Some distros also set up some wrappers that allow both packages to be installed
	in parallel and do the right thing in order to be able to deal with 2.4 and 2.6 kernels. Users should not need to care
	about the details, as long as they're running recent versions of those tools.</P
><P
>Now you know how modules get into the kernel.  There's a bit more to the story if you want to write your own modules
	which depend on other modules (we calling this `stacking modules').  But this will have to wait for a future chapter. 
	We have	a lot to cover before addressing this relatively high-level issue.</P

			their own groove.  Getting your first "hello world" program to compile and load correctly can sometimes be a trick.  Rest

					Until we cover modversions, the examples in the guide may not work if you're running a kernel with modversioning
					turned on.  However, most stock Linux distro kernels come with it turned on.  If you're having trouble loading the
					modules because of versioning errors, compile a kernel with modversioning turned off.</P

>Modules can't print to the screen like <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"

					warnings, which ends up being printed on your screen, but only on a console.  If you insmod a module from an xterm,
					the information and warnings will be logged, but only to your log files.  You won't see it unless you look through
					your log files.  To have immediate access to this information, do all your work from the console.</P

>1.2.1.3. Compiling Issues and Kernel Version</H3
><P
>Very often, Linux distros will distribute kernel source that has been patched in various non-standard ways,
					which may cause trouble.</P
><P
>A more common problem is that some Linux distros distribute incomplete kernel headers.  You'll need to compile
					your code using various header files from the Linux kernel.  Murphy's Law states that the headers that are missing are
					exactly the ones that you'll need for your module work.</P
><P
>To avoid these two problems, I highly recommend that you download, compile and boot into a fresh, stock Linux
					kernel which can be downloaded from any of the Linux kernel mirror sites.  See the Linux Kernel HOWTO for more
					details.</P
><P
>Ironically, this can also cause a problem.  By default, gcc on your system may look for the kernel headers in
					their default location rather than where you installed the new copy of the kernel (usually in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/</TT
>.  This can be fixed by using gcc's <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-I</TT
> switch.</P
