>5.3. Manage /proc file with standard filesystem</H1
><P
>	We have seen how to read and write a /proc file with the /proc interface. But it's also possible
	to manage /proc file with inodes. The main interest is to use advanced function, like permissions.
	</P
><P
>	In Linux, there is a standard mechanism for file system registration. Since every file system has to have its own
	functions to handle inode and file operations<A
NAME="AEN814"
HREF="#FTN.AEN814"
><SPAN
CLASS="footnote"

></A
>,
	there is a special structure to hold pointers to all those functions, <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>struct inode_operations</TT
>, which
	includes a pointer to <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>struct file_operations</TT
>. In /proc, whenever we register a new file, we're allowed to
	specify which <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>struct inode_operations</TT
> will be used to access to it. This is the mechanism we use, a
	<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>struct inode_operations</TT
> which includes a pointer to a <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>struct file_operations</TT
> which
	includes pointers to our <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>procfs_read</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>procfs_write</TT
> functions.
	</P
><P
>	Another interesting point here is the <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>module_permission</TT
> function. This function is called whenever
	a process tries to do something with the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc</TT
> file, and it can decide whether to allow
	access or not. Right now it is only based on the operation and the uid of the current user (as available in
	<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>current</TT
>, a pointer to a structure which includes information on the currently running process), but it
	could be based on anything we like, such as what other processes are doing with the same file, the time of day, or the last
	input we received.</P
><P
>	It's important to note that the standard roles of read and write are reversed in the kernel. Read functions are used for
	output, whereas write functions are used for input. The reason for that is that read and write refer to the user's point of
	view --- if a process reads something from the kernel, then the kernel needs to output it, and if a process writes something
	to the kernel, then the kernel receives it as input.
