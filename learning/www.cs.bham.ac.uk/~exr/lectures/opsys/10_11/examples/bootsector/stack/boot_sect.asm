  mov bp, 0x8000   ; Set the base of the stack a little above where BIOS
  mov sp, bp       ; loads our boot sector - so it won't overwrite us.

  push 'A'         ; Push some characters on the stack for later
  push 'B'         ; retreival.  Note, these are pushed on as
  push 'C'         ; 16-bit values, so the most significant byte
                   ; will be added by our assembler as 0x00.

  pop bx           ; Note, we can only pop 16-bits, so pop to bx
  mov al, bl       ; then copy bl (i.e. 8-bit char) to al

  pop bx           ; Pop the next value
  mov al, bl

  mov al, [0x7ffe] ; To prove our stack grows downwards from bp,
                   ; fetch the char at 0x8000 - 0x2 (i.e. 16-bits)
