On completion of this course, the student should be able to:
<UL>
	<LI> Understand the role of an operating system
	<LI> Understand how the decomposition of a program into
	processes affects its behaviour.
	<LI> Analyse known scheduling algorithms and adapt them for
	new situations.
        <LI> Suggest appropriate memory management algorithms for a
        variety of situations.
        <LI> Find the additional problems when transferring a concrete
	situation from a monoprocessor system to a distributed
	environment and solve the arising co-ordination problems.
        <LI> Devise appropriate security mechanisms in a given
	situation and understand the role operating system can and
	should play in establishing security.
</UL>

<P>Basic knowledge of Computer Architecture and algorithms as taught
in Introduction to Computer Science (for the undergraduates) and
Fundamentals of Computer Science (for MSc students).

<P> 20 hours of lecture together with exercises classes. I will give
out an exercise sheet every two weeks which I will mark on a voluntary
basis and provide a class test during reading week, which the students
will mark themselves. In addition there will be practical
exercises, which will consist in implementing some of the algorithms
described in the course. Neither the exercise sheets nor the class
test nor the practical exercises count towards the module mark.

<OL>
	<LI> <strong> Function of Operating Systems  </strong> <BR>
	     I start the course by explaining the function of an
	     operating system in general terms and list necessary
	     prerequisites of the hardware. (2 lectures)
	<LI> <strong> Processes </strong> <BR>
	     The concept of a process is fundamental for an operating
	     system. I will discuss the states of a process and
	     discuss process scheduling in some detail because it is
	     paradigmatic for many other resource allocation problems
	     in operating systems. Afterwards I will discuss threads
	     (lightweight processes). They are introduced to reduce the
	     time necessary for context switches. (4 lectures)
	<LI> <strong> Memory Management </strong> <BR>
	     An absolutely crucial aspect of every operating system is memory
management. It arises because main memory is a limited resource, which
has to be used as efficiently as possible. This part discusses memory
management strategies and their dependence on the behaviour of programs
on one side and on properties of the hardware on the other side. I
will discuss virtual memory in detail. (4 lectures)
        <LI> <strong> File Systems </strong> <BR>
Again, the physical constraints of a disk have a great impact on the
design of a file system. This part of the course shows how the
principles discussed for process scheduling and memory management
apply to file systems. (3 lectures)
	<LI> <strong> Distributed Systems </strong> <BR>
	A whole series of new problems arise when one considers distributed
operating systems. I will present the various models that have been
proposed (shared memory, loosely coupled etc.) and discuss their
relative merits.
I will stress co-ordination problems which are at the heart of
distributed systems. (4 lectures)
<LI> <strong> Security </strong> <BR>
     I will discuss various meanings of the term ``security'': data
integrity, protection against user errors and protection against
malicious users.
I will use access control as an example to illustrate common problems
in this area. (3 lectures)
</OL>

Synchronisation is an important part of any operating system. This is
not part of this course because it is covered in detail in Dr Axford's
course on Real-time systems programming. Also I will omit material
about networks which is a separate course in the third year.
