# Here is the source code structure for main application code and the
# linked_list code, which we've separated out into a library
#
# The source code in this example is identical to the last example with the
# only changes being:
#
#  #include "linked_list.h" -> #include <linked_list.h>
#
# in the files todo_list.c and linked_list.c, which serve to decouple the
# library header file from the source code.  This means then when compiling,
# we must add the directory of that header file to the search path.

Makefile             # Top-level Makefile which drives sub-makefiles

src
  Makefile           # Main application Makefile
  todo_list.c
  user_interface.h   # We chose not to put these files in their
  user_interface.c   # own library, which would be excessive.

libs                 # Folder to hold library code
  linked_list        # Our linked list library
    include          # Include files for using library
      linked_list.h
    src              # Library source files
      Makefile       # To build the library
      linked_list.c
