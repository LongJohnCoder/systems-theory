6.828: Learning by doing
</H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
6.828 teaches the fundamentals of engineering operating systems.
You will study, in detail, virtual memory, kernel and user mode, system
calls, threads, context switches, interrupts, interprocess
communication, coordination of concurrent activities, and the
interface between software and hardware.  Most importantly, you will
study the interactions between these concepts, and how to manage the
complexity introduced by the interactions.

<p>
6.828 is organized in three parts: lectures,
readings, and a sequence of programming labs.  The lectures and readings familiarize you
with the main concepts. The labs lead you to understand the concepts
at a deep level, since you will build an operating system from the
ground up. After the labs you will appreciate the meaning of design
goals such as "reducing complexity" and "conceptual integrity".

<p>
The lectures are organized in two main blocks.  The first block
introduces one operating system, <a href="xv6.html"<i>xv6
(x86 version 6)</i></a>, which is a re-implementation of Unix Version
6, which was developed in the 1970s. In each lecture we will take one
part of xv6 and study its source code; homework assignments will help
you prepare for these lectures.  At the end of the first block (about
half-way through the term), you will understand the source code for one
well-designed operating system for an Intel-based PC, which will help you
in building your own operating system.

<p>The second block of lectures covers important operating systems
concepts invented after Unix v6.  We will study the more modern
concepts by reading research papers and discussing them in lecture.
You will also implement some of these newer concepts in your operating
system.

<p>You may wonder why we are studying an operating system that
resembles Unix v6 instead of the latest and greatest version of Linux,
Windows, or BSD Unix.  xv6 is big enough to illustrate the basic
design and implementation ideas in operating systems.  On the other
hand, xv6 is far smaller than any modern production O/S, and
correspondingly easier to understand.  xv6 has a structure similar to
many modern operating systems; once you've explored xv6 you will find
that much is familiar inside kernels such as Linux.

<p>The labs are the place where the rubber meets the road.  In the labs
you will internalize the details of the concepts and their
interactions.  For example, although you have seen virtual memory in
6.004, 6.033, and again in 6.828 lectures, you may discover
during the labs that you didn't fully understand virtual memory and
how it interacts with other concepts.

<p>The labs are split into 6 major parts that build on each
other, culminating in a primitive operating system on which you
can run simple commands through your own shell.

<p>The operating system you will build, called <i>JOS</i>, will have
Unix-like functions (e.g., fork, exec), but is implemented in an
exokernel style (i.e., the Unix functions are implemented mostly in a
user-level library instead of in the kernel). The major parts
of the JOS operating system are:
<ol>
  <li>Booting
  <li>Memory management
  <li>User environments
  <li>Preemptive multitasking
  <li>File system, spawn, and shell
  <li>Network driver
</ol>

<p>We will provide skeleton code for pieces of JOS, but you will have to do
all the hard work.
You'll have design freedom for the details of the first few assignments,
and freedom over the whole design in the last assignments.
You'll find that xv6 helps you understand many of the goals you're
trying to achieve in JOS, but that JOS occupies a very different
point in the design and implementation space from xv6.

<p>You'll do the six labs individually. You have the option to substitute
a final JOS-related project for the sixth lab; if you do a project, you can
do it in a team of one, two, or three students.

<p>You will develop your JOS operating system for a standard x86-based
personal computer, the same one used for xv6.  To simplify development
we will use a complete machine simulator (QEMU) in the class for
development and debugging.  This simulator is real enough, however,
that you will be able to boot your own operating system on physical
hardware if you wish.

<p>At the end of the labs you will be able to find your way around the
source code of most operating systems, and more generally, be
comfortable with system software.  You will understand many operating
systems concepts in detail and will be able to use them in other
environments. You will also understand the x86 processor and the C
programming language well.

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>6.828 would not exist today had it not been for a wonderful set of past TAs
(Josh Cates, Austin Clements, Russ Cox, Bryan Ford, Max Krohn, and Emil
Sit). They made this class a reality. Collectively we dedicate 6.828 to the
memory of Josh Cates; we hope that many students will be inspired by Josh's
enthusiasm for operating systems, and have named the operating system
<i>JOS</i>.

We are also grateful to the students and teaching staff at Harvard, MIT
(including SIPB), UCLA, and NYU for their many contributions.
