<h1>Homework: User-level threads</h1>

<p>In this assignment you will complete a simple user-level thread package by
implementing the code to perform context switching between threads.  Submit
your solutions before the beginning of the next lecture to <a
 href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2017/handin.py/">the submission web site</a>.

<h2>Switching threads</h2>

<p>Download <a href="uthread.c">uthread.c</a> and <a
 href="uthread_switch.S">uthread_switch.S</a> into your xv6 directory.
Make sure <tt>uthread_switch.S</tt> ends with <tt>.S</tt>, not
<tt>.s</tt>.  Add the
 following rule to the xv6 Makefile after the _forktest rule:
<pre>
_uthread: uthread.o uthread_switch.o
	$(LD) $(LDFLAGS) -N -e main -Ttext 0 -o _uthread uthread.o uthread_switch.o $(ULIB)
	$(OBJDUMP) -S _uthread > uthread.asm
</pre>
Make sure that the blank space at the start of each line is a tab,
not spaces.

<p>
Add <tt>_uthread</tt> in the Makefile to the list of user programs defined by UPROGS.

<p>Run xv6, then run <tt>uthread</tt> from the xv6 shell. The xv6 kernel will print an error message about <tt>uthread</tt> encountering a page fault.

<p>Your job is to complete <tt>thread_switch.S</tt>, so that you see output similar to
this (make sure to run with CPUS=1):
<pre>

</pre>

<p><tt>uthread</tt> creates two threads and switches back and forth between
them. Each thread prints "my thread ..." and then yields to give the other
thread a chance to run. 

<p>To observe the above output, you need to complete <tt>thread_switch.S</tt>, but before
jumping into <tt>uthread_switch.S</tt>, first understand how <tt>uthread.c</tt>
uses <tt>thread_switch</tt>.  <tt>uthread.c</tt> has two global variables
<tt>current_thread</tt> and <tt>next_thread</tt>.  Each is a pointer to a
<tt>thread</tt> structure.  The thread structure has a stack for a thread and a
saved stack pointer (<tt>sp</tt>, which points into the thread's stack).  The
job of <tt>uthread_switch</tt> is to save the current thread state into the
structure pointed to by <tt>current_thread</tt>, restore <tt>next_thread</tt>'s
state, and make <tt>current_thread</tt> point to where <tt>next_thread</tt> was
pointing to, so that when <tt>uthread_switch</tt> returns <tt>next_thread</tt>
is running and is the <tt>current_thread</tt>.

<p>You should study <tt>thread_create</tt>, which sets up the initial stack for
a new thread. It provides hints about what <tt>thread_switch</tt> should do.
The intent is that
<tt>thread_switch</tt> use the assembly instructions <tt>popal</tt> and
<tt>pushal</tt> to restore and save all eight x86 registers.
Note that <tt>thread_create</tt> simulates eight pushed registers (32 bytes)
on a new thread's stack.

<p>To write the assembly in <tt>thread_switch</tt>, you need to know how the C
compiler lays out <tt>struct thread</tt> in memory, which is as
follows:

<pre>
    --------------------
    | 4 bytes for state|
    --------------------
    | stack size bytes |
    | for stack        |
    --------------------
    | 4 bytes for sp   |
    --------------------  <--- current_thread
         ......

         ......
    --------------------
    | 4 bytes for state|
    --------------------
    | stack size bytes |
    | for stack        |
    --------------------
    | 4 bytes for sp   |
    --------------------  <--- next_thread
</pre>

The variables <tt>next_thread</tt> and <tt>current_thread</tt> each contain the
address of a <tt>struct thread</tt>.

<p>
To write the <tt>sp</tt> field of the struct that <tt>current_thread</tt>
points to, you should write assembly like this:

<pre>
   movl current_thread, %eax
   movl %esp, (%eax)
</pre>

This saves <tt>%esp</tt> in <tt>current_thread->sp</tt>.  This works because
<tt>sp</tt> is at
offset 0 in the struct.
You can study the assembly the compiler generates for
<tt>uthread.c</tt> by looking at <tt>uthread.asm</tt>.

<p>To test your code it might be helpful to single step through your
<tt>thread_switch</tt> using <tt>gdb</tt>.  You can get started
in this way:

<pre>
(gdb) symbol-file _uthread
Load new symbol table from "/Users/kaashoek/classes/6828/xv6/_uthread"? (y or n) y
Reading symbols from /Users/kaashoek/classes/6828/xv6/_uthread...done.
(gdb) b thread_switch
Breakpoint 1 at 0x204: file uthread_switch.S, line 9.
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p>The breakpoint may (or may not) be triggered before you even run
<tt>uthread</tt>. How could that happen?

<p>Once your xv6 shell runs, type "uthread", and gdb will break at
<tt>thread_switch</tt>.  Now you can type commands like the following to inspect
the state of <tt>uthread</tt>:

<pre>
(gdb) p/x next_thread->sp
$4 = 0x4ae8
(gdb) x/9x next_thread->sp
0x4ae8 <all_thread+16360>:      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x4af8 <all_thread+16376>:      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x4b08 <all_thread+16392>:      0x000000d8
</pre>
What address is <tt>0xd8</tt>, which sits on the top of the stack of <tt>next_thread</tt>?

<div class="question">
<p><b>Submit</b>: your modified uthread_switch.S
</div>


<h2>Optional challenges</h2>

<p>The user-level thread package interacts badly with the operating system in
several ways.  For example, if one user-level thread blocks in a system call,
another user-level thread won't run, because the user-level threads scheduler
doesn't know that one of its threads has been descheduled by the xv6 scheduler.  As
another example, two user-level threads will not run concurrently on different
cores, because the xv6 scheduler isn't aware that there are multiple
threads that could run in parallel.  Note that if two user-level threads were to
run truly in parallel, this implementation won't work because of several races
(e.g., two threads on different processors could call <tt>thread_schedule</tt>
concurrently, select the same runnable thread, and both run it on different
processors.)

<p>There are several ways of addressing these problems.  One is using <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduler_activations">scheduler
activations</a> and another is to use one kernel thread per user-level thread
(as Linux kernels do).  Implement one of these ways in xv6.

<p>Add locks, condition variables, barriers, etc. to your thread package.
