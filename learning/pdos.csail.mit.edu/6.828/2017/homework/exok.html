<h1>Homework: OS Organization</h1>


<p>Submit two items to the <a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2017/handin.py/">the submission web
    site</a>:
  <ul>
    
    <li>Submit your own question about the paper (e.g., what you find most
confusing about the paper or the paper's general context/problem) before 11:59pm
the night before. You cannot use the question below. To the extent possible,
      during lecture we will try to answer questions submitted the evening before.
      
    <li>Submit your answer for the question below before the beginning of the lecture

  </ul>
<p>

<p>This lecture will provide an introduction to operating system organizations,
monolythic, microkernel, etc.  Please read the assigned paper, which describes the exokernel
organization.  The JOS operating system you are building in the labs is
organized like an exokernel.

<div class="question">
<p><b>Answer the following question</b>: In lab 4 you completed building the core of an
exokernel-based operating system.  In class you studied xv6, a
monolithic operating systems.  Both are intend to support the UNIX
API, but their internal organizations are different.  A good example
is the virtual memory implementation: JOS implements many
virtual-memory-related functions (such as <tt>fork</tt>) in its
library operating system, while xv6 implements them in the kernel.
Give an concrete example of what a user program could do in JOS that a
user-level program on xv6 is unable to do and why it is useful.
