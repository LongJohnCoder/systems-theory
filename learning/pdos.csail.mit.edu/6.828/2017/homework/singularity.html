<h1>Homework: Singularity</h1>


<p>Submit two items to the <a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2017/handin.py/">the submission web
    site</a>:
  <ul>
    
    <li>Submit your own question about the paper (e.g., what you find most
confusing about the paper or the paper's general context/problem) before 11:59pm
the night before. You cannot use the question below. To the extent possible,
      during lecture we will try to answer questions submitted the evening before.
      
    <li>Submit your answer for the question below before the beginning of the lecture

  </ul>
<p>

<div class="question">
  <p><b>Answer the following question</b>:

In Singularity only one process can have a pointer to an object in the exchange
heap.  Ben proposes to modify Singularity to maintain a reference count for each
object in the exchange heap and collect the object when the reference count is
zero.  When a process dies, he arranges to decrease the reference counter for
each object in the exchange heap to which the dying process has a pointer.

In Ben's design several processes can share an object in the heap.  This would
allow Ben to use the exchange heap, for example, for a shared buffer cache.

What problem does Singularity try to solve by disallowing shared objects in the
exchange heap?
