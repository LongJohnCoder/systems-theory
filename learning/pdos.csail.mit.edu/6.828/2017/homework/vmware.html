<div class="question"> <p><b>Answer the following question</b>:

The translated version of <tt>isPrime</tt> shown towards the end of 
Section 3.2 of the Adams/Agesen paper
does not end with a <tt>ret</tt> instruction;
instead, it ends with a <tt>jmp</tt> through <tt>%gs</tt>.
What return instruction pointer is on the stack when
<tt>isPrime</tt> starts, and why
can't the translated <tt>isPrime</tt> return directly to that address?
