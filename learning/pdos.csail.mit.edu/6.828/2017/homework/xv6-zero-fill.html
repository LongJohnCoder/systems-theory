<h1>Homework: xv6 lazy page allocation</h1>

<p>Submit your solutions before the beginning of the next lecture to the <a
 href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2017/handin.py/">submission web site</a>.

<p>
One of the many neat tricks an O/S can play with page table hardware
is lazy allocation of heap memory. Xv6 applications ask the kernel for
heap memory using the sbrk() system call. In the kernel we've given
you, sbrk() allocates physical memory and maps it into the process's
virtual address space. There are programs that allocate memory but
never use it, for example to implement large sparse arrays.
Sophisticated kernels delay allocation of each page of memory until
the application tries to use that page -- as signaled by a page fault.
You'll add this lazy allocation feature to xv6 in this exercise.

<h2>Part One: Eliminate allocation from sbrk()</h2>

Your first task is to delete page allocation from the sbrk(n) system
call implementation, which is the function sys_sbrk() in sysproc.c. The
sbrk(n) system call grows the process's memory size by n bytes, and
then returns the start of the newly allocated region (i.e., the old
size). Your new sbrk(n) should just increment the process's size
(proc->sz) by n and return the old size. It should not allocate memory
-- so you should delete the call to growproc() (but you still need to
increase the process's size!).

<p>
Try to guess what the result of this modification will be: what will
break?

<p>
Make this modification, boot xv6, and type <tt>echo hi</tt> to the shell.
You should see something like this:

<pre>
init: starting sh
$ echo hi
pid 3 sh: trap 14 err 6 on cpu 0 eip 0x12f1 addr 0x4004--kill proc
$ 
</pre>

The "pid 3 sh: trap..." message is from the kernel trap handler in
trap.c; it has caught a page fault (trap 14, or T_PGFLT), which the xv6 kernel
does not know how to handle. Make sure you understand why this page
fault occurs. The "addr 0x4004" indicates that the virtual address
that caused the page fault is 0x4004.

<h2>Part Two: Lazy allocation</h2>

Modify the code in trap.c to respond to a page fault from user space
by mapping a newly-allocated page of physical memory at the faulting
address, and then returning back to user space to let the process
continue executing. You should add your code just before
the <tt>cprintf</tt> call that produced the "pid 3 sh: trap 14"
message. Your code is not required to cover all corner cases and
error situations; it just needs to be good enough to let sh
run simple commands like echo and ls.

<p>
Hint: look at the cprintf arguments to see how to find the virtual
address that caused the page fault.

<p>
Hint: steal code from allocuvm() in vm.c, which is what sbrk()
calls (via growproc()).

<p>
Hint: use PGROUNDDOWN(va) to round the faulting virtual address
down to a page boundary.

<p>
Hint: <tt>break</tt> or <tt>return</tt> in order to avoid
the <tt>cprintf</tt> and the <tt>proc->killed&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</tt>.

<p>
Hint: you'll need to call mappages(). In order to do this you'll need
to delete the <tt>static</tt> in the declaration of mappages()
in vm.c, and you'll need to declare mappages() in trap.c.
Add this declaration to trap.c before any call to <tt>mappages()</tt>:
<pre>
      int mappages(pde_t *pgdir, void *va, uint size, uint pa, int perm);
</pre>

<p>
Hint: you can check whether a fault is a page fault by checking if
<tt>tf->trapno</tt> is equal to <tt>T_PGFLT</tt> in trap().

<p>
If all goes well, your lazy allocation code should result in <tt>echo
hi</tt> working. You should get at least one page fault (and thus lazy
allocation) in the shell, and perhaps two.

<p>
By the way, this is not a fully correct implementation. See the challenges
below for a list of problems we're aware of.

<p>
Optional challenges: Handle negative sbrk() arguments. Handle error cases such
as sbrk() arguments that are too large. Verify that fork() and exit()
work even if some sbrk()'d address have no memory allocated for them.
Correctly handle faults on the invalid page below the stack. Make sure
that kernel use of not-yet-allocated user addresses works -- for example,
if a program passes an sbrk()-allocated address to read().
