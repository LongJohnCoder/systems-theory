6.828 2017 Lecture 5: Isolation mechanisms

Today:
  user/kernel isolation
  xv6 system call as case study

* How to choose overall form for a kernel?
  many possible answers!
  one extreme:
    just a library of device drivers, linked w/ app
    run application directly on hardware
    fast and flexible for single-purpose devices
    but usually multiple tasks on a computer

* Multiple tasks drive the key requirements:
  multiplexing
  isolation
  interaction

* helpful approach: abstract resources rather than raw hardware
  File system, not raw disk
  Processes, not raw CPU/memory
  TCP connections, not ethernet packets
  abstractions are often easier to isolate and share
    e.g. programs see a private CPU, needn't think about multiplexing
  also more convenient and portable

* Isolation is often the most constraining requirement.

* What is isolation?
  enforced separation to contain effects of failures
  the process is the usual unit of isolation
  prevent process X from wrecking or spying on process Y
    r/w memory, use 100% of CPU, change FDs, &c
  prevent a process from interfering with the operating system 
  in the face of malice as well as bugs
    a bad process may try to trick the h/w or kernel

* the kernel uses hardware mechanisms as part of process isolation:
  user/kernel mode flag
  address spaces
  timeslicing
  system call interface

* the hardware user/kernel mode flag
  controls whether instructions can access privileged h/w
  called CPL on the x86, bottom two bits of %cs register
    CPL=0 -- kernel mode -- privileged
    CPL=3 -- user mode -- no privilege
  x86 CPL protects many processor registers relevant to isolation
    I/O port accesses
    control register accesses (eflags, %cs4, ...)
      including %cs itself
    affects memory access permissions, but indirectly
    the kernel must set all this up correctly
  every serious microprocessor has some kind of user/kernel flag
    
* how to do a system call -- switching CPL
  Q: would this be an OK design for user programs to make a system call:
    set CPL=0
    jmp sys_open
    bad: user-specified instructions with CPL=0
  Q: how about a combined instruction that sets CPL=0,
    but *requires* an immediate jump to someplace in the kernel?
    bad: user might jump somewhere awkward in the kernel
  the x86 answer:
    there are only a few permissible kernel entry points ("vectors")
    INT instruction sets CPL=0 and jumps to an entry point
    but user code can't otherwise modify CPL or jump anywhere else in kernel
  system call return sets CPL=3 before returning to user code
    also a combined instruction (can't separately set CPL and jmp)

* the result: well-defined notion of user vs kernel
  either CPL=3 and executing user code
  or CPL=0 and executing from entry point in kernel code
  not:
    CPL=0 and executing user code
    CPL=0 and executing anywhere in kernel the user pleases

* how to isolate process memory?
  idea: "address space"
  give each process some memory it can access
    for its code, variables, heap, stack
  prevent it from accessing other memory (kernel or other processes)

* how to create isolated address spaces?
  xv6 uses x86 "paging hardware" in the memory management unit (MMU)
  MMU translates (or "maps") every address issued by program
    CPU -> MMU -> RAM
            |
         pagetable
    VA -> PA
    MMU translates all memory references: user and kernel, instructions and data
    instructions use only VAs, never PAs
  kernel sets up a different page table for each process
    each process's page table allows access only to that process's RAM
  
### Let's look at how xv6 system calls are implemented

xv6 process/stack diagram:
  user process ; kernel thread
  user stack ; kernel stack
  two mechanisms:
    switch between user/kernel
    switch between kernel threads
  trap frame
  kernel function calls...
  struct context

* simplified xv6 user/kernel virtual address-space setup
  FFFFFFFF:
            ...
  80000000: kernel
            user stack
            user data
  00000000: user instructions
  kernel configures MMU to give user code access only to lower half
  separate address space for each process
    but kernel (high) mappings are the same for every process

system call starting point: 
  executing in user space, sh writing its prompt
  sh.asm, write() library function
  break *0xb90
  x/3i 0xb8b
    0x10 in eax is the system call number for write
  info reg
    cs=0x1b, B=1011 -- CPL=3 => user mode
    esp and eip are low addresses -- user virtual addresses
  x/4x $esp
    cc1 is return address -- in printf
    2 is fd
    0x3f7a is buffer on the stack
    1 is count
    i.e. write(2, 0x3f7a, 1)
  x/c 0x3f7a

INT instruction, kernel entry
  stepi
  info reg
    cs=0x8 -- CPL=3 => kernel mode
    note INT changed eip and esp to high kernel addresses
  where is eip?
    at a kernel-supplied vector -- only place user can go
    so user program can't jump to random places in kernel with CPL=0
  x/6wx $esp
    INT saved a few user registers
    err, eip, cs, eflags, esp, ss
  why did INT save just these registers?
    they are the ones that INT overwrites
  what INT did:
    switched to current process's kernel stack
    saved some user registers on kernel stack
    set CPL=0
    start executing at kernel-supplied "vector"
  where did esp come from?
    kernel told h/w what kernel stack to use when creating process

Q: why does INT bother saving the user state?
   how much state should be saved?
   transparency vs speed

saving the rest of the user registers on the kernel stack
  trapasm.S alltraps
  pushal pushes 8 registers: eax .. edi
  x/19x $esp
  19 words at top of kernel stack:
    ss
    esp
    eflags
    cs
    eip
    err    -- INT saved from here up
    trapno
    ds
    es
    fs
    gs
    eax..edi
  will eventually be restored, when system call returns
  meanwhile the kernel C code sometimes needs to read/write saved values
  struct trapframe in x86.h

Q: why are user registers saved on the kernel stack?
   why not save them on the user stack?

entering kernel C code
  the pushl %esp creates an argument for trap(struct trapframe *tf)
  now we're in trap() in trap.c
  print tf
  print *tf

kernel system call handling
  device interrupts and faults also enter trap()
  trapno == T_SYSCALL
  myproc()
  struct proc in proc.h
  myproc()->tf -- so syscall() can get at call # and arguments
  syscall() in syscall.c
    looks at tf->eax to find out which system call
  SYS_write in syscalls[] maps to sys_write
  sys_write() in sysfile.c
  arg*() read write(fd,buf,n) arguments from the user stack
  argint() in syscall.c
    proc->tf->esp + xxx

restoring user registers
  syscall() sets tf->eax to return value
  back to trap()
  finish -- returns to trapasm.S
  info reg -- still in kernel, registers overwritten by kernel code
  stepi to iret
  info reg
    most registers hold restored user values
    eax has write() return value of 1
    esp, eip, cs still have kernel values
  x/5x $esp
    saved user state: eip, cs, eflags, esp, ss
  IRET pops those user registers from the stack
    and thereby re-enters user space with CPL=3

Q: do we really need IRET?
   could we use ordinary instructions to restore the registers?
   could IRET be simpler?

back to user space
  stepi
  info reg

*** fork()

let's look at how fork() sets up a new process
in particular, how to get the new process into user space the first time?
the idea:
  fork() fakes a kernel stack that *looks* like it's about to return from trap()
    with a faked trapframe at the top
  child starts executing in the kernel -- at a function return instruction
  alltraps "restores" faked saved registers
  starts executing the child for the first time

note there are two separate actions:
  create a new process
  execute the new process

break fork
c
where

fork() in proc.c

allocproc()
  look at proc[] at start of proc.c
  focus on initial content of p->kstack
  space for trap frame (will be a copy of parent's)
  fake saved EIP that points to trapret in trapasm.S
  kernel stack space for a "context"
    contains *kernel* registers
    to be restored when switching to child's kernel thread
    proc.h
  the p->context->eip = forkret sets up where child starts in the kernel
    basically just a fuction call instruction

back to fork()
  (remember we're still executing as the parent)
  allocate physical memory and a page table
  copy parent's memory to child
  copy trapframe
  tf->eax = 0 -- this will the child's return value from fork():w
  print *np
  print *np->tf
  print *np->context
  x/25x np->context
  state = RUNNABLE -- now we are done

the new process's kernel stack:
  trapframe -- copy of parent, but eax=0
  trapret's address
  context
    eip = forkret

break forkret
x/20x $esp
next
finish
(now in trapret in tramasm.S)
at b6a in sh.S
info reg
and eax is zero -- it's the child
