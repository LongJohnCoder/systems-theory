PROHST is a preliminary version of a utility to process the profile
file produced by the PROFIL utility of MSDOS.
Those of you familiar with MS-Pascal or MS-Fortran will have little
difficulty in understanding how the parameters work. There are three,
the .PRF filename, an optional histogram file (default extension .HST,
default name same as the .PRF file) and an optional link map. If the
link map was produced with the line number options PROHST will try
and relate buckets to line numbers. Otherwise, it will relate it to
module offsets. If you specify no map file (the default), addresses
relative to the start of the program will be used. The default extension
for the map file is .MAP.

a:prohst f;

this will produce a histogram for the file f.prf in f.hst and no map file
will be assumed.

a:prohst f,,;

this will produce a histogram for f.prf in f.hst and expects a f.map file.

a:prohst f,g,k

this produces a histogram for f.prf in g.hst and expects a map file k.map.

Note that if you select the map option with line numbers, the program will
appear to be looping. Never fear, go and have lunch or some other time
consuming pastime, and you will be suprised how long it took to produce
such a small file. Also, some of the line number/bucket correspondances are
not what they might be. Future version shoudl fix this. If you make a better
version, be sure to let me have a copy.
