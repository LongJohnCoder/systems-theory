Dear Mr. Rodic,

You have Red Hat, Inc.'s permission to use our Shadowman logo and trademark in the attached form
solely for the use shown in the document you have hyperlinked at http://futurist.se/gldt/gldt1004.png,
that is, on a GNU/Linux pictorial timeline where the image is used adjacent to a point on the timeline
that represents the beginning of the Red Hat Linux distribution.  The logo must be approximately the
same size as the Debian and Slackware logos you are also using. 

I very much appreciate that you asked for permission.  Please use the logo attached rather than the one
that you currently have, since the one you are currently using is not quite correct (he has a stumpy neck).
If Wikipedia requires further information or verification that Red Hat has granted you permission for this
use, I will be happy to assist you.

Best regards,

Pamela S. Chestek

Dear Mr. Rodic:

I apologize for the delay, my request for a logo got lost in our work queue.  You will find an svg
version attached.  The display size of the logo you are using in the file attached is acceptable.

Please, though, do not make the svg version of the logo publicly available other than as part of the
overall cladogram.

Best regards,

Pamela S. Chestek
