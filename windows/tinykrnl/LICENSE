You may distribute the software and modifications to the software for non-commercial purposes, but
only to other eligible users of the software (ie, users which will agree to this license). You may
not grant rights to the software or derivative works that are broader than those provided by this
license. For example, you may not distribute modifications of the software under terms that would
permit commercial use, or under terms that purport to require the software or derivative works to
be sublicensed to others.

You may use any information in intangible form that you remember after accessing the software. However,
this right does not grant you a license to any copyrights or patents for anything you might create
using such information.

In return for the license rights above, you must agree to these obligations:

    1. You will not remove any copyright or other notices from the software, nor reverse engineer or
       decompile binary portions of the software, unless your laws give you the right to do so despite
       this restriction.

    2. You will include a verbatim copy of this license if you distribute the software in any form.

    3. If you distribute derivative works of the software in source code form you will do so only under
       this license, and if you distribute derivative works of the software solely in object form you
       will do so only under a license that complies with this license.
    
    4. If you have modified the software or created derivative works, and distribute such modifications
       or derivative works, you will cause the modified files to carry prominent notices describing your
       changes and the date of the changes, so that recipients know that they are not receiving the
       original software.

    5. THE SOFTWARE COMES "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTIES. THIS MEANS NO EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY
       WARRANTY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

    6. TINYKRNL WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING
       DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT THE LAW
       PERMITS, NO MATTER WHAT LEGAL THEORY IT IS BASED ON. YOU MUST PASS THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
       ON WHENEVER YOU DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE OR DERIVATIVE WORKS.

    7. If you sue anyone over patents that you think may apply to the software or anyone's use of the
       software, your license to the software ends immediately.

    8. You will not use the software to aid the development of any software programs that are designed
       to:
            (a) harm or intentionally interfere with the operation of a computer system including any
                data or information stored on such computer system; and/or
            (b) surreptitiously gain or maintain high level access to a computer system, self-propagate,
                and/or execute in a manner that prevents detection, including but not limited to,
                so-called “rootkit” software programs, viruses, or worms.
    
    9. Your rights under the license end immediately if you breach it in any way.

    10. TinyKRNL reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this license.
