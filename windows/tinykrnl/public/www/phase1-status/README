# 1. Your php.ini need's to allow PHP to fopen to open files trough HTTP
     Inorder to do that change the following line in php.ini
     allow_url_fopen = OFF to allow_url_fopen = On

     Or else it wont be able to grab the data from the modules status.txt


# 2. Add following FLAGS to the every module status.txt files inorder to display 
     the Boots,Works,Mature flags on the status page

     Example of lines to add to module status.txt to get status.php view that the module
     Boots,Works, and is Mature...

     Boots: 1
     Works: 1
     Mature: 1

     Example of lines to add to module status.txt to get status.php view that the module 
     only boots...

     Boots: 1
     Works:
     Mature:

     As you can see, we only checks if one of these flags is = 1, 
     otherwise dont display that on the status page

# 3. The file we want to open with our webbrowser is status.php
     files.php and definitions.php is included in status.php

# 4. Edit the following lines in status.php...
     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://www.tinykrnl.org/sinorca-screen.css" media="screen" title="Sinorca (screen)" />
     <link rel="stylesheet alternative" type="text/css" href="http://www.tinykrnl.org/sinorca-screen-alt.css" media="screen" title="Sinorca(alternative)" />
     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://www.tinykrnl.org/sinorca-print.css" media="print" />
  
     I specified the whole HTTP location to the css files just to be able to test the design on my webserver.


Hope you find any use of this PHP script
