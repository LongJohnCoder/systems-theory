    AP Console AppWizard : [!output PROJECT_NAME] Project Overview
========================================================================

The AP Console application wizard has created this [!output PROJECT_NAME] project for you as a starting point. 
This project contains a simple console application that uses no pre-compiled headers and uses the
AP C++ classes designed for use in Advanced Placement Computer Science courses.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that make up your project.

[!output PROJECT_NAME].vcproj :
    This is the main project file for projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of the product that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

main.cpp : 
    Defines the entry point for the console-mode application.
    
apstring.cpp:
	Contains the implementation of the APString class, which is commonly used in projects
	using the AP classes.    

readme.txt : 
    This text file.


========================================================================
    NOTES
========================================================================
The main.cpp file contains include statements for all of the header files listed below.
This allows you to use the classes defined in the header files in your application.

	apvector.h
	apstring.h
	apqueue.h
	apstack.h
	apmatrix.h
	
If you need the .cpp files for these classes, you can add the appropriate .cpp file to your
project. To do this, simply right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and choose
Add Existing Item from the Add menu. Navigate to the "VC7/include/AP" folder inside the
Microsoft Visual Studio.NET folder (located where you installed the application) and choose
the files you wish to add to this project.
