<H1><A NAME="security"></A>4.13. Security</H1>

<P>To ensure the security of your system, it is essential that you keep your system up to date by installing the latest service packs, security patches, and hotfixes. In addition, it is important that users are granted only the minimum privileges needed. For more information about security for Microsoft operating systems, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/Default.asp" target="_blank">Security</A>. At this Web site, you can read about the security issues and find out about the latest service packs, hotfixes and security patches. For additional security information, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/tools/stkintro.asp" target="_blank">The Microsoft Security Toolkit</A>.</P>

<P>The following sections provide a list of known security issues associated with Assignment Manager.</P>

<H1><A NAME="ntfsquotas"></A>4.13.1. Implementing Disk Quotas for NTFS Partitions</H1>

<P>To prevent the drive capacity from being exceeded with output from a single student assignment, use of NTFS is recommended for the drive on which Assignment Manager is installed. The Assignment Manager program creates a user called AssignmentManager that performs auto build and auto check functions. NTFS allows you to set a disk quota for the AssignmentManager user, and thus prevents the drive capacity from being exceeded beyond the quota value you set. Disk quotas cannot be set on FAT or FAT32 partitions. For more information about security problems associated with the FAT and FAT32 file systems, see Section 4.13.3 in this readme, "Potential Security Problems Associated with Auto Build and Auto Check."</P>

<P>Auto build and auto check are performed on one assignment at a time and the output from these tools is deleted from the disk before the tools are run on the next assignment. As a result, the maximum disk quota allotted to the AssignmentManager user should be determined from the size of the NTFS partition to which the quota is applied and the expected auto build and auto check output for a single student assignment.</P>

<P>Use the following procedure to enable disk quotas on a Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, Windows&nbsp;.NET Standard Server, or Windows&nbsp;.NET Enterprise Server. Disk quotas should be enabled prior to installing Assignment Manager.</P>

<P class="labelproc"><B>To enable disk quotas for your Assignment Manager server</B>

<OL type="1"><li>Double-click <B>My Computer</B> on the desktop.</li>
<li>Right-click the icon for the NTFS partition for which you want to enable disk quotas, and choose <B>Properties</B>.</li>
<li>Click the <B>Quota</B> tab, and select the <B>Enable</B> <B>quota</B> <B>management</B> check box.</li>
<li>Select the options you want to apply to your NTFS partition.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disk quotas are disabled by default for Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, Windows&nbsp;.NET Standard Server, and Windows&nbsp;.NET Enterprise Server.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</li>
</OL>

<P>After enabling disk quotas, install Assignment Manager. For more information, see Section 2.3 in this readme, "Installing Assignment Manager."</P>

<P>After you have installed Assignment Manager with auto check and auto build enabled, you need to activate the AssignmentManager user before you can set disk quotas for this user. </P>

<P class="labelproc"><B>To activate the AssignmentManager user</B>

<OL type="1"><li>Create an assignment that uses auto build, and auto check in Assignment Manager. </li>
<li>Add this course to the student client, and then submit this assignment to Assignment Manager through the student client. 
<P>When Assignment Manager builds and checks this assignment using the auto build and auto check features, respectively, the AssignmentManager user is activated and an entry for this user is placed in the quota entries table. 
</li>
</OL>

<P>For more information about these steps, see the Visual Studio .NET Academic Teaching Tools Guide and the Visual Studio .NET Academic Student Tools Guide.</P>

<P>You can now set the disk quota for this user using the following procedure.</P>

<P class="labelproc"><B>To set disk quotas for the AssignmentManager user</B>

<OL type="1"><li>Double-click <B>My Computer</B> on the desktop.</li>
<li>Right-click the icon for the NTFS partition with enabled disk quotas, and choose <B>Properties</B>.</li>
<li>Click <B>Quota Entries</B>.
<P>The AssignmentManager user name is displayed in the quota entries table.
</li>
<li>Double-click <B>AssignmentManager</B> from the list of quota entries.</li>
<li>On the <B>General</B> tab, set quotas for the AssignmentManager user.</li>
</OL>

<P>As an alternate approach, you can enable disk quotas for all new users of the server prior to installing Assignment Manager using the following procedure. This approach applies one quota to all new users. This quota will be applied to the AssignmentManager user, the first time that auto build and auto check are run.</P>

<P class="labelproc"><B>To enable disk quotas for all new users</B>

<OL type="1"><li>Double-click <B>My Computer</B> on the desktop.</li>
<li>Right-click the icon for the NTFS partition for which you want to enable disk quotas, and choose <B>Properties</B>.</li>
<li>Click the <B>Quota</B> tab, and select the <B>Enable</B> <B>quota</B> <B>management</B> check box.</li>
<li>Click <B>Limit disk space to</B>, and enter a limit in the text box.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This limit is the default limit applied to all new users of this NTFS partition. You can edit the limit for each new user using the procedure specified above for setting the disk quota for the AssignmentManager user. Existing users of the NTFS partition retain their individual quotas.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</li>
</OL>

<H1><A NAME="fat32"></A>4.13.2. FAT and FAT32 Security Issues</H1>

<P>Members of the <B>Users</B> group on a Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000 Advanced Server have read/write access on FAT and FAT32 disk partitions. The AssignmentManager user, which performs auto build and auto check functions, is a member of this group. By extension, student programs that are executed by the auto check feature have read/write access to the partition. Installing Assignment Manager on an NTFS partition is a more secure solution than using a FAT or FAT32 partition because the <B>Users</B> group does not have access to write to the system folders, and because you can set disk quotas for the user.</P>

<P>If Assignment Manager is installed on a FAT or FAT32 partition, student users can read and write files at any location on the partition. This can be a security issue for a number of reasons. For example, the student could read secure information or could write files that are automatically run and can potentially cause damage to the system.</P>

<P>It is recommended that you use NTFS for the partition. NTFS supports file permissions, while FAT and FAT32 do not.</P>

<H1><A NAME="autochecksecurity"></A>4.13.3. Potential Security Problems Associated with Auto Build and Auto Check</H1>

<P>Auto build and auto check allow untrusted code to be compiled and run on the Assignment Manager server. If the auto build and auto check features of Assignment Manager are enabled, then the student's code represents a potential threat to security. Specifically, students may be able to gather information about the server or cause damage to the server through the code they submit.</P>

<P>If you are concerned about security risks, you can disable auto build and auto check. For more information about how to disable auto build and auto check, see "Modifying Server Settings" in the Visual Studio .NET Academic Teaching Tools Guide.</P>

<H1><A NAME="uploadingassignments"></A>4.14. Uploading of Assignments does not Work after Visual Studio&nbsp;.NET is Uninstalled and Reinstalled</H1>

<H1><A NAME="addroles"></A>4.15 Adding Additional Roles to the Administrator</H1>

<P>Users with the Administrator role should not add additional roles for themselves, such as the Faculty role. If a user with the Administrator role does try to add another role to themselves, an error message is displayed and the user loses all privileges.</P>

<P>To work around this, add a new user with administrator privileges, and then log in as the new Administrator. After you have logged in as the new Administrator, edit the roles of the original Administrator. For more information, see "Default Assignment Manager Role Permissions and Accessing User Accounts" in the Visual Studio .NET Academic Teaching Tools Guide.</P>
